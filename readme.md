## FreeStuffDev
List of free services for developer like database, hosting, authentication and other stuff.  
Check it at [freestuff.dev](https://freestuff.dev)  

I listed many tools at my private note before, why not bring it to the public?
Inspired by [other similar sites](https://freestuff.dev/tags/other-list/), suprisingly not many alternative out there, so I create my own dev-tool list to start prototyping or making a MVP.

Built with Hugo Static site generator and hosted at Netlify

title = "Your service name"

free feature 2
free feature 3
```

P.S:

- You can use any image for thumbnail, but try to avoid using small favicons(16x16) as each **image will be resized to 80x80**
- For existing tags visit https://freestuff.dev/ and open the "Filter"
- At the end write the features as one feature per line
